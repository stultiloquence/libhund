done

- quality 1: size of separators
	- compare to that of mt-kahypar with 2^d blocks

todo

1. when attempting multiple bisections in parallel, what is the difference between the worst, the best, and average bisections?
	- for different parameters / parameter variation to figure out a reasonable one
2. performance:
	- compare with mt-kahypar with 2^d
	- profiling of different parts of the code
	- Catch2 BENCHMARK
3. quality 2: relative increase in nnz (needs LU) -> compare with other libs
4. Expand CLI
5. Clean up repository
6. Clean up build process
7. Systematically run and evaluate and tweak using the tests
8. Add additional correctnes tests
	- empty hyperedges o__o
9. Expand documentation and README

optional

- Use external library for local reordering (currently returning identity permutations)
- Refactoring some overly complicated methods
- Support additional matrix formats
